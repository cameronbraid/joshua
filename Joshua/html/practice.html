      This is a h1 heading for my practice program.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      This is a h2 heading for my practice program.
    </h2>
    <p>
      And this is a paragraph for... you guessed it. My practice program!
    </p>
    <p class="important red">
      Warning: this is warning sign.
    </p>
    <h2 class="typewriter">
      This is a heading in typewriter text.
    </h2>
    <p class="typewriter">
      This paragraph is also in typewriter text.
    </p>
    <h2 class="italic">
      This heading is in italics.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I <em>really</em> think that this paragrph uses <i>way</i> too many words
      in <span class="italic">italics</span> and <strong>heaps</strong> of bold
      words when it would be better using <b>none</b> of them.
    </p>
    <p class="extra-spacing">
      I am using way too much spacing for this paragraph.
    </p>
    <h3>
      I have centered this heading.
    </h3>
    <p class="justify">
      Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      This paragraph has its first line indented. I think first line indents
      look rather stupid, but that's just my opinion.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        I am a paragraph in blockquote tags.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="big-margin">
      Most coders can find some use for margins. Unfortunately, some also
      overuse it.
    </p>
    <p class="border">
      Boders have many uses in styling, and can be used very creatively.
    </p>
    <h4>
      You can also group elements that share one or more styles.
    </h4>
    <p class="center">
      An example is this paragraph and the heading above.
    </p>
    <h2 id="id-element">
      All elements must have unique IDs. IDs are a way of targeting one
      particular element in your document, as each element must have a different
      ID.

    <div id="middle">
      <h2>
        Both this heading
      </h2>
      <p>
        and this paragraph are contained in a div.
