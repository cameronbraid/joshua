For a rectangle, coordinates of 76,42,279,510 mean the clickable rectangle begins 76 pixels in from the left edge of the image and 42 pixels down from the top of the image, and extends right by 279 pixels from the left edge of the image and 510 pixels down from the top of the image. For a circle, coordinates of 100,60,10 mean the clickable circle has a center at 100 pixels in from the left edge of the image and 60 pixels down from the top of the image, and has a radius of 10 pixels. For a polygon, coordinates of 150,217,190,257,150,297,110,257 create a diamond shape. The top point of the diamond is 150 pixels in from the left edge of the image and 217 pixels down from the top of the image. The right point of the diamond is 190 pixels in from the left edge of the image and 257 pixels down from the top of the image, and so on. Three sets of coordinates create a triangle area, five sets a pentagonal area, and so on.
